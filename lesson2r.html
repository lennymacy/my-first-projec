          <div Class="decisions"><em>Decisions, Decisions</em></div>
          <p id="p2">With so many types of RV's to choose from, the first thing we recommend is asking yourself these three simple questions:</p>
            <UL class="questions">
              <LI>Will I be a weekend camper, take a trip for a month, or live full time in my RV?
              <LI>Do I want to drive in my RV or am I willing to tow it?
              <LI>How much do I want to spend on my RV?
              <LI>How much do I want to spend on an RV?
            </UL>
            <p id="p3">Once you can answer those basic questions, the combination of answers will guide you to the right type of <b>MODEL.</b > From there you can begin to shop for your RV and research manufacturers that make that type. Remember that purchasing an RV is like a car: if you but one new, as soon as you roll it off the lot, it has depreciated in value -  sometimes significantly. So what kind kind of RV's are there? Let us show you the most typical models of RVs and how they may or may not fit the answers you gave to those questions. We will classify them into two catergories: <em>motorhomes and towables</em> and work our way down from the costliest to the least expensive so you can see how your decision affects your budget.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="type"><b>MOTORHOMES</b></p>
            <p><img src="image/classa.png" alt="image missing">Class A RV's are easily recognizable by their large size and boxy shape. They are a motorhome that is more like home than not. They are built on a large chassis and may have either a gas engine or a diesel. Diesel engines are usually in the rear and thus often called a <em>diesel pusher</em>. They sure aren't the most economical vehicles on the road either in term of mpg (<em>think 8 to 10 mpg</em>). And did we mention that they are very large? Some are as long as 45 feet, but that means lots of space. Class A motorhomes are a favorite with <a href="http://www.fulltime-rving.com">RV full timers.</a> Class A RVs are loaded with many luxurious amenities. <b>They can sleep 6, 8, even 10 people</b>. Portions will slide out and increase the floor space and living area significantly. Most have separate master bedrooms with large closets. Some models have dining sets that convert to beds, fully equipped kitchens, large luxurious bathrooms, and bunk beds in addition to the master bedroom. But be wary as the large size can make them difficult to drive. <b>Repairs can be costly as well</b>, so it is essential to be prepared for those potential additional expenses. They can also be difficult to fit into certain spots especially at campgrounds.
            </p>
            <p><img src="image/classc.png" alt="image missing">These vehicles make use of a standard cargo van frame and chasis, typically the Ford E350 or E450. The front end of a Class C will look more like a van as opposed to the Class A. That will give you better access to the cab with a door on each side. Another common feature is how the camper portion extends over the cab and for the most part, houses a sleeping area. You will find most amenities more than adequate: a fold out sleeper sofa, dinettes that convert to an additional bed, a refrigerator, a microwaven oven, a complete bathroom with shower, sufficient storage, and sometimes even a private master suite. Some will even have a slide-out increasing the living space. They too can often sleep up to 10 people and can vary in length from the low 20s to up to 35 feet. You will find service and warranty work easier to obtain and less costly. Gas mileage may be a bit better than in a Class A, but not by much. Some manufacturers have began building a super-sized class C built on a large truck chasis and those types of Class C models can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. More typically, you will find the entry level models starting somewhere around the $50,000 dollar price range.
            </p>
            <p><img src="image/classb.png" alt="image missing">From the outside, the Class B motorhome looks very much like an oversized van. They are also commonly known as camper vans. Inside, the van is tall enough for standing room. Even though there is a kitchen, living room, and a bathroom, it is very small. The toilet and shower are combined into one space. Most Class B motorhomes do not have slide outs. In terms of cost, these motorhomes are the least expensiveout of the three types although their are some that are changing that. Since these motorhomes are the smallest, they are the easiest to drive and have the best fuel economy. Parking the vehicle also is rarely a problem because of its size. Many owners rave how they can drive their RV to the beach and park among all the other vehicles. However, the biggest downside is that the compact size limits storage. If you value how economical the Class B motorhome is, then this is the one for you.
              <br><br>
            <p class="type"><b>TOWABLES</b></p>
            <p><img src="image/fiver.png" alt="image missing">Another very popular RV for those planning to full time is the 5th wheel RV, also know as a <em>Fiver</em>. A Fiver attaches to the tow vehicle the same way those large trucks you see going down the highway attach to their trailer. These RV's can often rival a Class A in amenities. You can find these anywhee in size from around 20 feet to 45 feet. One advantage of a Fiver is the stabilty in towing; however the larger ones will take a large diesel pick-up truck to pull it, which will add more to the overall cost of owning one. Fivers tend to offer plenty of room with some having five to six slides-outs, greatly increasing the square footage of living space. Another great feature of the Fiver is that many are now built with insulation similiar to a house and thus extreme tempertures of the four seasons are less of an issue. You will find these denoted as <em>Four Season Ready.</em> There are also many types of floor plans to choose from as well. Another advantage of these RV's is the amount of storage space which is located under the front portion of the living space that is raised due to the hitch. The latest industry trend is to make them smaller and lighter for smaller tow vehicles. Thus you can now find these ranging in price from under $40,000 to close to $200,000 for the bigger and most decked out ones. Another popular feature is the <em>Toy Hauler</em> version. A toy hauler has a garage in the rear to place motorcycles, four-wheelers, or any other large toy you may want to take on the road with you.
            </p>
            <p><img src="image/travelt.png" alt="image missing">Next down in price comes the travel trailer, or  the <em>TT</em> as it is often called. The difference between the TT and the Fiver is that the TT attaches to the tow vehicle using a ball and hitch, a far more common type of way to tow a trailer. Towing can be a bit more difficult - an even weight distribution of your cargo is extremely important to prevent what is know as <a href=https://www.trailervalet.com/blog/how-to-avoid-trailer-sway/>Trailer Sway.</a> Often much lighter that a Fiver, they can generally be towed by a lighter truck sucn as a half ton gasoline powered pickup. Most will still have a complete bathroom with shower, a kitchen, good storage space, a living area with a sleeper sofa, and a seperate bedroom. Some will also have <em>bunk rooms</em>, dinettes that convert to beds, and many can sleep up to 8 to 10 people. Other features include tvs, air conditioning just like all the motorhomes and the Fivers mentioned previously. Smaller travel trailers can be found for under $20,000 and the larger ones can go up to the mid 60's, if not, even more. Like their Fiver counterparts, they range in size from the low 20's to over 40 feet in length.
            </p>
            <p><img src="image/teardrop.png" alt="image missing">A teardrop trailer is a streamlined, compact, lightweight travel trailer, which gets its name from its teardrop profile. The streamlined shape, small size, and low weight allow for easy towing including with many midsized family car and small SUVs. While being small they have enough room to sleep two or three people and have a kitchenette located outside in the back under a rear cover (think like the truck of a car.) The sleeping cabin is hardsided and topped, eliminating the need for setup and tear-down. They offer some cargo storage and many are designed to allow the sleeping area to double as cargo space while driving. That outside kitche area has ample storage space for a cooler - some do have a minifrig, dry goods, a portable stove/grill, and sufficient counter space. You can find some with a built in stove and sink. Depending on amenties and size, the price can range anywhere from around $5000 to over $20,000. One thing they do lack is a bathroom, but like all of our previously mentined RV's, they will hook up to electic and water the same way, if equipped accordingly.
            </p>
            <p><img src="image/popup.png" alt="image missing">The most obviuos quality of the popup camper is its ability to "popup" but its compact size can also be its downfall too. When packing items to take with you, one must adhere to the saying: "If it cannot fold into a small size, then you cannot have it." Its lightweight and compact size make it simple to tow even for a novice, and most likely, you will not have to upgrade your tow vehicle. They are also one of the most economical ways to enter the world of RVing. Basic popups usually include fold-down dinettes, an on board fresh water tank, a sink, interior LED lighting, two sleeping bunks and storage cabinets. The soft sided vinyl shell making them prone to adverse tempertures is being overcome by one of the more recent innovations in the RV market: the recent <em>A-FRAME</em> hard sided popup. These new types of RVs, being hardsided, offer AC and some even have bathrooms similiar to those found in a Class B Motorhome.
